    Do they ask much for me?
</p>
<h4 class="name nurse">NURSE.</h4>
<p>
You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.
</p>
<h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
<p>
Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I
was before.
</p>
<h4 class="name nurse">NURSE.</h4>
<p>
Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.
</p>
<h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
<p>
Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if she
went away altogether?
</p>
<h4 class="name nurse">NURSE.</h4>
<p>
Good heavens!—went away altogether?
</p>
<h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
<p>
Nurse, I want you to tell me something I have often wondered about—how
could you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers?
