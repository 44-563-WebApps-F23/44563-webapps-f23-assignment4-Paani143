    Do they ask much for me?
</p>
<h4 class="name nurse">NURSE.</h4>
<p class="speech">
You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.
</p>
<h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
<p class="speech">
Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I
was before.
</p>
<h4 class="name nurse">NURSE.</h4>
<p class="speech">
Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.
</p>
<h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
<p class="speech">

went away altogether?
</p>
<h4 class="name nurse">NURSE.</h4>
<p class="speech">

</p>
<h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
<p class="speech">
